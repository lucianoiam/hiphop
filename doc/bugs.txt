- (Linux) Drag and drop not working on both WebKitGTK and CEF web views.

- (Linux) Broken CSS viewport units (vw/vh/vmin/vmax) on WebKitGTK variant due
  to workaround for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229227

- (macOS) Possibly not a bug: the spacebar on REAPER is reserved for toggling
  transport, therefore it is not possible to type spaces into <input> elements.
  Also these elements do not emit events of type 'change' when pressing Return.
  To fix enable "Send all keyboard input to plug-in" in the plugin context menu.
